git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

Always branch from the latest version of `dev`.

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

> `mamba_inference`, `sota-configs-lra`, or `weights-biases-support`.

## âœ… Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Feature description"
git push origin your-feature-name
```

## ðŸ“¬ Create a Pull Request

- Go to your fork on GitHub.
- Click **Compare & pull request**.

- Assign the pull request to the maintainer (e.g., @REPO_OWNER).
- Submit the PR.

## ðŸ§¹ After Your PR Is Merged

You can delete your branch after itâ€™s merged:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
